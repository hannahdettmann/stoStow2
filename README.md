This project was created to aid in the organization of student governmet storage. The application allows users to add new items to storage as well search and locate items already in storage. Eventually, we hope to implement a system which allows users to 'check out' items and update the database accordingly. 

This project will not only save time for students who are locating items, it is also projected to save money and ensure students are not re-buying products which already exist.
